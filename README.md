# Competitions
My codes in various competitions and hackathons!!!

Some of them might seem bizarre and some of them might even look waaaaaay too simple - but they were all the result of endless brain-storming, moments of self-doubt midway through the competition and a bit of luck asw. A few of the codes which made me win competitions aren't even complete codes but that was the situation for most of us giving our best shot out there - and on those occasions I was blessed to be the better one compared to the other amazing coders.
